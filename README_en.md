### 📖 **Core Concept: OrderState Regulation Warfare (ORW)**

**TWS is not designed to directly launch a physical attack 💣 on the physical defense lines of the Taiwan authorities. Instead, it aims to construct a "hyper-gravitational, irresistible 'OrderState Value Basin'" 🌌. Through this, we will systematically and on a massive scale, siphon Taiwan's populace, enterprises, capital, data, and talent into a digital sovereign system we have built, effectively performing a strategic drain from the economic, civil, cultural, psychological, and even jurisprudential dimensions.**

When a sufficient number of OrderState units complete this irreversible migration, the tax base of the Taiwan authorities will be hollowed out, their governance power will be suspended, and the public's allegiance will be redirected. Their physical existence will be reduced to an empty shell 🏛️, devoid of soul and foundation.

At that point, unification will no longer be a military operation requiring immense sacrifice, but a natural, inevitable outcome driven by the will of the people 🌊.

**This is "OrderState Regulation Warfare"—the art of bloodless liberation in a new era 🎨.**

### 🚀 **The 9 Core Modules of TWS**

#### **1. 🆔 Digital Identity Verification (DID)**
- **Action:** Taiwanese citizens voluntarily sign the **"Patriot's Agreement"** on the TWS platform to apply for a digital resident ID card of the People's Republic of China.
- **Data Required:** Genealogical records dating back to at least 1895 (a tribute to Professor Victor Gao), a live facial recognition video, geo-location data, and valid identification documents.
- **🌟 Legacy of Honor:** Records of ancestors' heroic and just acts in resisting foreign invasion or promoting liberation can be uploaded. The state will posthumously recognize them as martyrs or patriotic heroes, award medals, and issue a **Family Honor Certificate**, ensuring that glory is no longer silenced and loyalty is passed down through generations!

#### **2. 💰 Digital Wallet Issuance**
- **Currency:** The TWS platform will issue the **Taiwan Province People's Stablecoin (TWCNY)**, pegged 1:1 to the offshore RMB.
- **Activation:** A TWS digital wallet is automatically activated for any new individual or organization that acquires a digital identity.

#### **3. ❤️ Patriotic Credit Points**
- **Learn to Earn:** The TWS platform will synchronize with patriotic educational resources like the "Xuexi Qiangguo" app, allowing the people of Taiwan Province to earn points through learning.
- **Act to Earn:** High point rewards will be given for various patriotic activities that promote national unification (e.g., reporting separatist activities, promoting unification, participating in community building).
- **Unlock Benefits:** The higher the points, the more benefits are unlocked (e.g., low-interest loans, housing subsidies, healthcare discounts, mainland travel subsidies).
- **🚀 Leverage the Future:** Points can be **locked with leverage**. After complete unification, they can be unlocked and redeemed for a **massive welfare package** (e.g., real estate, equity, cash). Your confidence in and participation in unification will determine your future socio-economic status!

#### **4. 🏢 Business License Digitalization**
- **Streamlined Process:** Business owners can upload their current business license, financial statements, and intellectual property certificates to receive a digital business license for the Taiwan Province of the PRC **within minutes**.
- **Fraud-Proof:** Blockchain's immutability ensures that any attempt to falsify economic data is permanently recorded and cross-verified.
- **National Empowerment:** Enterprises can apply for certifications such as "High-Tech Enterprise," "Gazelle Company," or "Little Giant," and participate in national science and technology programs.
- **Instant Funding:** Government subsidies and grants are disbursed मशीन द्वारा अनुवादित (machine-translated) and automatically via smart contracts, ensuring high efficiency and transparency. **We are building the world's most friendly, convenient, and fair business environment on the blockchain!**

#### **5. 💸 Tax Reduction & Rebates**
- **Rebate Mechanism:** Individuals or enterprises can receive TWCNY tax rebates by uploading authentic tax payment receipts.
- **Globally Lowest Tax Rates:** Enterprises established on TWS will enjoy some of the lowest tax rates in the world, with **corporate income tax waived for the first five years (and not exceeding 5% thereafter), and VAT reduced to as low as 0.1%**.
- **Clean & Efficient Governance:** Blockchain + AI drastically improves government efficiency, eliminates corruption, and significantly reduces administrative costs, meaning the people do not need to bear a heavy tax burden.

#### **6. 🤝 Cross-Strait Trade Connectivity**
- **Unified Grand Market:** Seamlessly integrate Taiwan Province into the nation's unified grand market.
- **Zero-Trust Cost:** Utilize smart contracts to automate and put the entire process of procurement, logistics, warehousing, customs, and payment settlement on-chain, drastically reducing financing and trust costs for SMEs.
- **Bypass SWIFT:** Enable peer-to-peer, 7x24, near-zero-cost value transfer, completely breaking free from the control of external financial systems.
- **Talent Mobility:** Encourage cross-strait remote work, promoting employment and a two-way flow of talent.

#### **7. 📈 Capital Market Construction**
- **On-Chain IPOs:** Establish a multi-layered capital market on TWS, encouraging Taiwan-based enterprises to list on TWS. Already-listed companies can issue secondary tokens on TWS.
- **RWA Financing:** Promote the tokenization of Real-World Assets (like real estate and infrastructure) for financing.
- **Futures on the Future:** Issue **"Unification Futures,"** such as a futures contract on the "Land Value Appreciation Index for the 1-km radius around Taipei 101 post-unification." This directly converts confidence in unification into a tradable financial product.

#### **8. 🏡 Decentralized Autonomous Community (DAO)**
- **Free Formation:** Based on geographical location or common interests, individuals can freely register and establish autonomous communities or groups (DAOs) at the city, district, township, or village level.
- **Community Self-Governance:** Internal public affairs of the community are decided by member votes and funded by the community treasury and public finance support from the TWS platform.
- **New Socialist Democracy:** Without surrendering private property rights, we can achieve optimal allocation of market elements, broad-based democracy in public decision-making, and fair distribution of social welfare, achieving a higher level of **grassroots democracy**.

#### **9. 🗳️ Provincial Elections & Local Enlistment**
- **Whole-Process Democracy:** Elect People's Representatives at all levels via a one-person-one-vote system on the blockchain, establishing People's Congresses and ensuring public disclosure and pledging of officials' assets.
- **People's Guard:** Active, retired, reserve, and age-eligible personnel in Taiwan can **publicly or covertly** join our military on TWS. They can upload training and combat records, claim tasks via crowdsourcing, and receive bonuses through their digital wallets (which can also be locked with leverage).

### 🌌 **Our Vision**

**The other side prides itself on being modern, democratic, free, prosperous, and the heir to我們的道统. We stand at a higher dimension, substantively advancing the liberation of Taiwan and the unification of our motherland.**

Enabling Taiwan Province to enter a new era based on blockchain technology will be the latest practice of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation!

We are not fighting with the Taiwan authorities for control over an island.

**We are inviting 23 million of our compatriots to board the great vessel of the Chinese nation's rejuvenation 🚢, to sail together towards the starry seas of human civilization ✨.**

**Let us advance and perfect this together!**

> **Note:**
> **OrderState Regulation Warfare (ORW):** This means not prioritizing the seizure of physical space, but rather competing for the right to define "survival and development." By creating a parallel digital society with "superior rules, lower costs, and a brighter future," we cause the opponent's social structure to internally, spontaneously, and irreversibly "relax" into a new steady state colorChoice we have set.
